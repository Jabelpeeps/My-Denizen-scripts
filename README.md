My-Denizen-scripts
==================
A collection of scripts, some of which I wrote from scratch, and
some of which are re-writes of ones I found on the Citizens Script Repo.

Bossfight
---------
The original version of this was provided as a single script and published by mythanical on the Citizens Repo.
As it was written for earlier versions of both Denizen and Sentry, I have extensively re-written this in order 
to get it working again with the current versions.  

In order to make it easier to have different Bosses configured on the same server, I have moved the scripts that only need to be provided once-per-server into a separate script. 

It is now mostly functioning, with further bugfixes to come...

Moontimes.yml
-------------
A script of entirely my own creation, using the moonphases tag to (at the moment) provide formatted announcements of the moon's phase to certain groups of players, and time of day announcements to all players.  My ultimate intention is to use this to run a different Boss-fight on each pahse of the moon in our quest world.
